# secret_todo_notes

A Flutter todo secret note app that manages todo notes. Development using MVVM with BLoC/Cubit, demonstrates clear separation of concerns using Cubits as ViewModels and etc. Though simple in features, it is intentionally over-engineered to highlight scalable, testable, and maintainable Flutter development practices.
